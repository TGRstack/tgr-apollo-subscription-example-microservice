Apollo Client 2.5 helps developers maximize the benefits of GraphQL across their entire development experience. Apollo VS Code leverages knowledge of your client and server schemas to drive features like autocomplete when building your queries, jump to schema definitions, and more.

We’re huge fans of TypeScript at Apollo, which is why we’re so excited that you can now automatically generate TypeScript definitions for local data with the Apollo CLI!

The Apollo Client DevTools Chrome extension has also been fully integrated with Apollo Client 2.5 to let you inspect your client schema details, run @client based queries and mutations, inspect the client side Apollo Cache, and watch fired queries, all inside your browser.
